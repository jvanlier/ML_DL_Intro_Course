ML & DL introduction course
=============================

This is a 2-day introductory course on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The first day covers Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, general methodology, Decision Trees, Random Forests and k-means clustering, using Python 3 and the open source libray `scikit-learn`. The second day covers Deep Learning basics using `keras`: simple Deep Learning classification compared to Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification. It is approx. 50% theory and 50% classroom practice, interleaved throughout the day.

The Notebooks were made initially with Jupyter Notebook, but are intended to be executed on Google Colab. Those with a bit more experience may choose to run the Notebooks locally using Jupyter, but be aware that there might be subtle differences in behaviour, or things might even break completely, due to package version differences with the latest Colab versions.

## Slides
The slides are a bit too large and are subject to frequent changes and updates. Git isn't a great solution for binary blobs like that. If you've followed the course and would like to receive a copy of the slides, feel free to reach out to jori `at` jvlanalytics `dot` nl.
